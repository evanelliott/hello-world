# hello-world
My first repository. A place for ideas, resources and discussions.


Hi! My name is Evan and I work as a data science consultant in the UK. I am passionate about unlocking value from raw data through carefully executed experiments, and I like building useful tools for data-driven decision making.

I have degrees in Mathematics and Meteorology from the universities of Nottingham and Reading, and my Masters thesis topic was on Bayesian updating via Kalman filters. I have previously worked for the world's largest independent renewable energy company, where I gained valuable experience of the common challenges relating to data products in a commercial setting, including software development best practices and ensuring return on investment.

I am responsible for providing technical consultancy services, and technical expertise in developing intelligent systems with machine learning and other data analytics capabilities. I am proficient in Python and SQL; I have a broad knowledge of the latest data science techniques, and a deep understanding of the process for extracting value from data: including data cleaning, data shaping, feature selection, model training, data and model validation, and model serving.

I am also a fan of visualization as I believe there's no better way to transfer knowledge than through well-designed infographics.

Get in touch if you would like to chat or suggest a project to work on together!

Thanks & happy coding,

Evan
