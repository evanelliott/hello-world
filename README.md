# hello-world
My first repository. A place for ideas, resources and discussions.


Hi! My name is Evan and I am 24 years old. I am an aspiring data scientist and I work for a company in the UK which specializes in location/GIS data.

My background is in mathematics and meteorology, and my previous work has involved data assimilation (how weather models incorporate observations). I proposed my own Masters thesis topic, suggesting a new way of improving forecasts by assimilating observation tendencies, a.k.a. time-derivatives. Nearly all weather models are built on a Bayesian framework, each new timestep is a combination of prior information, and observation likelihood. Recently, weather models use ensemble methods which means that uncertainties can be represented in future forecasts in a probabilistic manner. My dream is to enhance the world of meteorology by crossing the bridge into data science and bringing back cutting-edge technologies for the good of global weather forecasting.

I choose Python as my tool for data science. I have had a fair amount of experience with libraries NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib for the purposes of numerical modeling and statistical analysis. I am becoming familiar with Pandas database library, and I am very new to the ScikitLearn machine learning library.

The topics within data science which I like the most are the high-end technical areas like machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning (and it would seem I am not alone in this taste). I am also a fan of visualization as I believe there's no better way to transfer knowledge than through well-designed infographics.

Get in touch if you would like to chat or suggest a project to work on together!

Thanks & happy coding,
Evan
